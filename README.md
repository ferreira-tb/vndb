# VNDB Query
VNDB Query is a tool designed to help you interact with the [VNDB database](https://vndb.org/) via its [HTTPS API](https://api.vndb.org/kana).
For this purpose, it has a custom query builder created specifically to build queries for the VNDB API.

You can use VNDB Query to create applications, browser extensions or simply for some quick queries.
