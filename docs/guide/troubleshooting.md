# Troubleshooting

If you find some bug or have any doubts, open an issue in the [repository](https://github.com/ferreira-tb/vndb/issues).

Remember that it's also important to check the [original documentation for the VNDB API](https://api.vndb.org/kana), as it describes various peculiarities that need to be taken into account when using this package.

## Top level await

For simplicity, many examples in this documentation use [top level await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await#top_level_await). However, it's not possible to use the keyword [`await`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await) on its own everywhere.

For more information, check out [MDN's article explaining this use of await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#top_level_await).
